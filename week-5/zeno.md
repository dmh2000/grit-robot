# Zeno Phenomenom

- infinitely many switches in finite time

  - bad
  - simulation crashes
  - model not accurage
  - behavior ill-defined after zeno point
  - math convergent series
  - discrete infinite switches

- example
- x

  - { -1 x >= 0}
  - { 1 x < 0>}
  - chatters at x == 0

- Zeno Types : infinitely switches in finite time
  - type 1 : in a single time instance
    - detectable
    - can be handled
  - type 2 : not type 1 (bouncing ball)
    - hard to handle
