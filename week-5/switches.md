# Switches Everywhere

Controllers change based on actual conditions

behavior based robotics

## switches

- humanoid robot
  - leg dynamics change when stepping or grounded
- bouncing ball , air , ground
- locusts isolated, grouped

## switches by design

- automatic transmission
- aircraft takeoff, cruise, landing
- sensor network, turn on/off

## issues

- modeling
- stability and performance (t != infinity)
- composition
- any traps?
