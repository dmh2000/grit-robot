# convex and non-convex worlds

- in order of complexity
  - point world
    - could get stuck but unlikely if noise is included
  - circular obstacles
    - about the same as point world
  - convex obstacle
    - rectangle
    - if hitting side of obstacle, might get stuck
    - if perpendicular to the surface
    - blend or not doesn't help
    - add a new behavior
  - non-convex obstacles
    - flytrap, cul-de-sac
    - add a new behavior
  - Labyrinth
    - need additional behaviors
