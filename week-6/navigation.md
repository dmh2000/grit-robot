# a complete navigation system

- once FW is started, keep going until
- when closer to goal than whe started

- T = time of last switch
- progress: current ||x-xg|| < ||x(Î¤) - Xg|| position when started
- clear shot : <uao,ugtg> > 0 : uao.T @ ugtg > 0
- gtg -> induced mode:
  - ||x-xo|| == delta
    - <ugtg,uccfw> > 0 : counter clockwise
    - <ugtg,jcfw> > 0 : clockwise
    - record d(t) = ||x-xg||
    - ||x-xo||<delta
- leave induced mode when:
  - ||x-xg|| < d(t) and
  - <uao,ugtg> > 0

doesn't work due to practical considerations
