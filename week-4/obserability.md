# OBSERVABILITY

- discrete time system
- x_k1 = Ax_k
- y_k = Cx_k

- y0 = Cx0
- y1 = Cx1 = CAx0
- ...
- y_n-1 = CAn-1@x_0

## Observability Matrix

- obserability matrix = OMEGA
- completely obserabile (CO) if n = rank(OMEGA)

## Theorem #1

- the system is CO if and only if rank(OMEGA) = n

## Theorem #2

- pole placment ot arbitrary eigenvalues is possible IFF the system is CO
